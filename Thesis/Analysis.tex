\section{Analysis}

In this chapter, we delve into the detailed analysis of the epidemic spread within metapopulation networks using the models and strategies introduced in the previous chapter. The primary focus is on understanding the dynamics of infection spread and evaluating the effectiveness of the Connection-Proprotional Travel restriction strategy on a path graph (1-lattice). The path graph was chosen due to its simplicity, homogeneity, and ease of handling for analysis.  By examining both non-adaptive and adaptive models, we aim to provide insights into how different travel restriction strategies can influence the rate and pattern of infection spread across a network of interconnected subpopulations. We look into extending the findings from the 1-lattice to more natural clustered networks.We begin by analyzing the infection dynamics in a non-adaptive path graph, which serves as a baseline for understanding the fundamental behavior of the epidemic spread without any adaptive interventions. This analysis includes deriving the spread rate and validating it through numerical simulations. Following this, we explore the impact of adaptive strategies on the infection dynamics, particularly focusing on the spread rate and delay the infection.

\subsection{Non-Adaptive Path Graph}
In this subsection, we focus on the infection dynamics of the infected population ($I$) within a non-adaptive path graph. By sequentially analyzing the behavior of consecutive subpopulations, we aim to understand the expected exponential rise in infection levels. The primary objective is to derive the spread rate of the infection across the network. To achieve this, we will define the spread rate and examine the governing equations that describe the infection dynamics.

\end{center}

Let the network be an unweighted undirected path graph (1-lattice graph), and infinitely long on both sides. All subpopulations have a uniform/homogeneous population sizes $N_j=S_j+I_j+R_j\stackrel{!}{=}N$. The model hence follows the ODE system outlined in equation \ref{eq: SIR M}. We randomly select a subpopulation patch and designate it with index 1 and incrementally index each consecutive neighboring subpopulation to the right. We will be focusing on the group of subpopulations to the right side of subpopulation 1 though due to the symmetry of the network and the ODE system, the epidemic evolution of both sides are expected to be the same. In a pre-infection state, all subpopulations have $S_x=N,I_x=0,R_x=1$. We normalize the values of $S,I,R$ such that $N=1$ for the remainder of this chapter, as the scalar value does not impact the dynamics. To begin an infection scenario, we start with an initial condition where $I_1(0)=i_0$ and $S_1(0)=1-i_0$, where subpopulation 1 is the initially infected subpopulation.
For a randomly selected subpopulation $j$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \dot I_j(t) &= \beta S_j I_j - \gamma I_j - 2\mu I_j  + \mu I_{j+1}+ \mu I_{j-1} \\
    &= (\beta S_j - \gamma 2 \mu) I_j + \mu (I_{j+1}+ I_{j-1}).
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:I_j}
\end{equation}

The governing dynamics of the infection in subpopulation 1 is:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\dot I_1(t) &= (\beta S_1 - \gamma - 2\mu) I_1 + \mu I_2 + \mu I_0 \\
            &= \kappa I_1 + \mu I_2 + \mu I_0,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $\kappa = \beta-\gamma-2\mu$. $\kappa$ can be thought of as the exponential growth coefficient due to the SIR dynamics and outflowing infected diffusion. For the rest of the analysis, we'll be looking only at $\kappa>0$ as it is where a growing infection spread occurs most strongly.

Since $I_0(0)=I_2(0)$ starts at zero and the susceptible fraction starts at one, a first-order Taylor approximation can be made around $t=0$:
\begin{equation}
\dot I_1 \approx \kappa I_1.
\label{eq: kappa}
\end{equation}

Since the diffusion of infected individuals starts from index 1 and propagates to further away subpopulations, not-withstanding the impact of the internal transmission rate. Indeed, for $t \approx 0$, the infected population sizes $I_j$ is geometrically distributed where each consecutive subpopulation scales down by $\mu$. For sufficiently small $\mu<<1$, $I_{j+1} \approx 0$ with respect to $I_j$. Similar to the above linearization:
\begin{equation}
\dot I_j \approx \kappa I_j + \mu I_{j-1}.
\end{equation} 

Solving the differential equation for the linearized $\dot I_1$:
\begin{equation}
I_1 = I_0 e^{\kappa t}.
\end{equation}
Substituting for $j=2$ in the equation above:
\begin{equation}
\dot I_2=\kappa I_j +\mu I_0 e^{\kappa t}.
\end{equation}
This ODE can be solved analytically which results in:
\begin{equation}
I_2=I_0 \mu t e^{\kappa t}.
\end{equation}
Consequently, for $\dot I_3$:
\begin{equation}
\dot I_3=\kappa I_j +\mu^2 \kappa t e^{\kappa t},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
I_3 = I_0 \frac{\mu^2 t^2}{2} e^{\kappa t}.
\end{equation}
Through induction, it can be found that:
\begin{equation}
I_j=I_0 \frac{\mu^{j-1} t^{j-1}}{(j-1)!} e^{\kappa t}.
\end{equation}

To find the spread rate of the infection across the network, we solve for the time $t_{I_{j+1}=I_0} :=t_j$:
\begin{equation}
I_0 \frac{\mu^{j} t_j^{j}}{j!} e^{\kappa t_j} = I_0,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mu^{j} t_j^{j}}{j!} e^{\kappa t_j} = 1.
\label{eq:nonadaptiveSpreadExp}
\end{equation}
This unfortunately does not have a closed-form solution. However, a unique solution is guaranteed to exist, and since the function is monotonic and the root is simple, the solution can be found very easily numerically. To alleviate the numerical instability of higher and higher powers and factorial values, the log transform of the equation is solved instead:
\begin{equation}
\kappa t_j + j \ln(\mu t_j) - \ln(j!) = 0
\end{equation}

where the log of the factorial has very stable methods to solve \cite{C}.%REF

To test this solution, the expected time for $I_j = I_0$ was found numerically through simulation of the ODEs for a path graph network and also computed numerically from equation \ref{eq:nonadaptiveSpreadExp}. The expression is remarkably accurate in estimating the spread infection day of the subpopulations. Furthermore, the peak infection day can be inferred from the spread infection day as they each converge to the same slope, and the offset between them is approximately the time taken for one subpopulation to reach the peak infection day starting from $I_0$.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \caption{\small Simulation vs. analytical results for infection spread day. It can be seen that the time between $I_x(t)=i_0$ and $I_x(t)=sup(I_x(t))$ converges to a constant delay. Through this relationship, the spread infection days can be used to find the peak infection days.}
    \label{fig:Spread-and-Peak-Infection-Days-non-adaptive}
\end{figure}

Since we are interested in the spread rate of the infection, the objective is to derive the value ${\Delta t}_{j+1} := t_{j+1}-t_j$. The spread rate at $j+1$ is defined as $1/{\Delta t}_{j+1}$. To find it, we first use equation \ref{eq:nonadaptiveSpreadExp} to find $t_{j+1}$:

\begin{equation}
\kappa t_{j+1} + (j+1) \ln(\mu t_{j+1}) - \ln((j+1)!) = 0 
\end{equation}

Based on numerical results, we found that ${\Delta t}_{j}$ converges quickly to a constant value. Therefore, we apply an ansatz ${\Delta t}_{j+1} = t_{j+1} - t_j \approx {\Delta t}$ for $j \gg 1$, leading to $t_j \approx j \, \Delta t$.

\begin{equation}
\kappa \Delta t + j \ln\left( \frac{t_{j+1}}{t_j} \right) + \ln\left( \frac{\mu t_{j+1}}{j+1} \right) = 0
\end{equation}

After substituting $t_j \approx j \, \Delta t$, we find:

\begin{equation}
\kappa \Delta t + j \ln\left( \frac{j+1}{j} \right) + \ln\left( \mu \Delta t \right) = 0 
\end{equation}

Taking $\lim_{j \to \infty}$, and using $\ln\left( \frac{{j+1}}{j} \right) \approx \frac{1}{j}$, we get:

\begin{equation}
\kappa \Delta t + \ln( \mu \Delta t ) + 1 = 0
\end{equation}

This is still a transcendental function. However, a known solution for this equation uses the Lambert W function. Applying it here results in:

\begin{equation}
\Delta t = \frac{1}{\kappa} W\left(\frac{\kappa}{e \mu}\right)
\label{eq: Lambert W approximation}
\end{equation}

    \label{Spread Rates mu beta}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Adaptive path graph}
The next step is to derive the impact of the reactivity constant $\lambda$ on the spread rate and extrapolate this spread rate on more complex network topologies such as small-world networks and scale-free networks.

We again evaluate the same system but with individual restriction adaptivity, where $\bar \rho := 1 - \rho$ and $\rho(0) = 0$:

\begin{equation}
\dot \rho_{x,x'} = \lambda \mu \bar \rho (I_{x'} - I_x)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\dot I_x = \beta S I - \gamma I +  \sum_{x'} \mu (I_{x'} - I_x) \bar \rho_{x,x'}
\end{equation}

We also define the flow $f_{x,x'}(t)$, which is the rate of incoming infected individuals per unit time from subpopulation $x$ into $x'$, where 

\begin{equation}
f_{x,x'}(t) = \mu \bar \rho_{x,x'} I_{x'}
\end{equation}

Applying the same linearization as equation (3.4):

\begin{equation}
\dot I_j \approx \kappa I_j + \mu \bar \rho I_{j-1} 
\end{equation}

Substituting $I_1 = i_0 \kappa e^{\kappa t}$:

\begin{equation}
\dot{\bar{\rho}}_2(t) = - i_{0} \lambda \mu \bar \rho_{2}(t) e^{\kappa t}
\label{eq:dotRhoBar}
\end{equation}

The ODE in equation \ref{eq:dotRhoBar} can be solved using separation of variables as follows:

\begin{equation}
\dot{\bar{\rho}}_2(t) = - i_{0} \lambda \mu \bar \rho_{2}(t) e^{\kappa t}
\end{equation}

With the initial condition $\bar \rho_{2}(0) = 1$, we proceed as follows:
Dividing both sides by $\bar \rho_{2}$ and multiplying by $dt$, then integrating both sides:

\begin{equation}
\int \frac{1}{\bar \rho_{2}} \, d\bar \rho_{2} = - i_{0} \lambda \mu \int e^{\kappa t} \, dt
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\ln \bar \rho_{2}(t) = - \frac{i_{0} \lambda \mu}{\kappa} e^{\kappa t} + C_1
\end{equation}

Exponentiating both sides:

\begin{equation}
\bar \rho_{2}(t) = e^{C_1} e^{-\frac{i_{0} \lambda \mu}{\kappa} e^{\kappa t}}.
\end{equation}

Using $\bar \rho_{2}(0) = 1$ to find $C_1$:

\begin{equation}
\bar \rho_{2}(t) = e^{\frac{i_{0} \lambda \mu}{\kappa}} e^{-\frac{i_{0} \lambda \mu}{\kappa} e^{\kappa t}}
 = \exp\left(\frac{i_{0} \lambda \mu}{\kappa} \left( 1 - e^{\kappa t} \right)\right) 
\end{equation}

where $c := i_{0} \lambda \mu / \kappa$ is a dimensionless constant.

This shows that the rate of decay for the first applied restriction based on this adaptive strategy is super-exponential. This is an intuitive outcome of having the rate of change of $\rho$ be proportional to the incoming infected, which itself grows exponentially due to the internal infection rate. When simulating this system with sufficiently large $\lambda$, a somewhat unexpected result appears: it is found that adaptivity only delays the global infection spread instead of slowing down the spread rate. This can be seen in the infected evolution in all nodes in a simple SI epidemic model.

    This scale helps show that the first subpopulation starts at an initial infected prevalence of 
    $i_0=1e-5$ and the grows exponentially, which can be seen by the constant-slope line of the evolution with a slope $1/\kappa$. This same exponential evolution can also be seen for subpopulation 2, quickly reaches the value of $F_2$ when $\rho_{2,1}$ reaches 1. A later figure will show the growth towards this value. Interestingly, the remainder of the subpopulations have a non-linear slope until it reaches the same threshold $F_2$ at which point their respective restriction completely shut down and their behavior turns purely exponential}

    \caption{\small Evolution of mobility restrictions. It is worthy of note here that most $\rho$ values reach 1 significantly before the population's corresponding infected prevalence reaches any significant value. It can be also seen from this plot that $\rho_2$ reaches 1 before the second day of the scenario, while $rho_3$ has a non-zero initial growth rate.}
\end{figure}

It is also worth noting that due to this super-exponential growth, $\rho_{2,1}$ decays down to zero much faster than the internal infection spread $I_2$. This difference in rates can be used to analytically approximate the delay in infection spread $t_2$ in subpopulation 2 from subpopulation 1. This can be done by first finding the final cumulative amount of incoming infected $F_2$ where 
\begin{equation}F_2:=\int_0^\infty f_2(t)dt\end{equation}
 

\begin{equation}f_2(t)=\mu \bar \rho_2(t) I_1(t) = \mu \exp\left({c \left( 1 - e^{\kappa t} \right)}\right)i_0 e^{\kappa t} = \mu i_0 \exp\left({c \left( 1 - e^{\kappa t} \right)} +\kappa t\right)\end{equation}

An analytic solution for $F$ could be found using the exponential integral $\mathrm{Ei}$ function  $\int\exp(\exp(x))\,d x=\int{\frac{\exp(u)}{u}}\,d u={\mathrm{Ei}}(u)={\mathrm{Ei}}(\exp(x))$. However, a linearization of the exponent term was found to be sufficiently accurate based on the numerical simulation. We define the expression $E(t):=c\left( 1 - e^{\kappa t} \right)+\kappa t$ and linearize it around $t=0$: 
\begin{equation}E(t)\approx (-c\kappa+\kappa)t = \kappa (1-c) t\end{equation}
substituting the linearized $E(t)$ and $f_2(t)$ back into $F_2$, we get:
\begin{equation}F_2=\int_0^\infty \mu i_0 \exp\left(\kappa (1-c) t \right) dt = \frac{\mu i_0}{\kappa(c-1)}\end{equation}
dividing the numerator and denominator by $c=\frac{i_{0} \lambda \mu}{\kappa}$:
\begin{equation}
F_2=\frac{\frac{\kappa}{\lambda}}{\kappa\left( 1-\frac{1}{c} \right)}=\frac{1}{\lambda\left( 1-\frac{1}{c} \right)}
\end{equation}

While $F_2$ is evaluated from $t=0$ to $\infty$, due to the super-exponential rate of $f_2$, $F_2=F_2(\infty)\approx F_2(t_{f2})$ where $t_{f2}$ is a point in time where $\bar\rho(t_{f2})\approx 0$  $I({t_{f2}})\approx F_2$. This approximation can be validated by checking the value of $I_2$ in the numerical solution of the ODE at the point in time where $\bar\rho(t)\approx 0$ and check if $I(t)\approx F_2$. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=120mm]{Figures/F₂ vs λ (log-log)_β0.25_γ0.0_σ0.0_μ0.01_nPop15_kbar3_topologySmallWorld_λ1.0e7_mobBias0.0_h0.1_minh1.0e-9_nDays1000_I01.0e-5_critRange0.0.pdf}
    \caption{\small Validation of $I_2$ approximation at $t \approx t_{f2}$. The $F_2$ Estimate is $1/\lambda$ which in a log-log scale has a slope of $-1$. As can be seen here, this approximation is only valid for $\lambda>1/i_0$. Before this threshold, there is approximately no dependency of $F_2$ on $\lambda$ }

\end{figure}

This observation allows us to solve a simplified version of the ODE $\dot I_2(t)$ starting from $t=t_f$, with the initial conditions at that point in time.
\begin{equation} I_2(t) = \int_{t_{f2}}^t \left(i_{0} \mu \bar \rho_{2}{(t)} e^{\kappa t} + \kappa I_{2}{\left(t \right)}\right) dt\end{equation}
since $\bar \rho \approx 0$ for $t\ge t_{f2}$ 
\begin{equation}I_2(t) = \int_{t_{f2}}^t  \kappa I_{2}{\left(t \right)} dt = I_2(t_{f_2})e^{\kappa t} = F_2 e^{\kappa t} =\frac{e^{\kappa t}}{\lambda}\end{equation}
to find $t_2$, the value at which $I_2(t)=i_0$, 
\begin{equation}I_2(t) =\frac{e^{\kappa t_2}}{\lambda}\stackrel{!}{=} i_0\end{equation}
solving for $t_2$:
\begin{equation}t_2=\frac{\ln(i_0 \lambda)}{\kappa}\end{equation}
This relationship, as with the one for $F_2$, is only valid for $\lambda> \frac{1}{i_0}$. The most important observation from this finding is that the delay in infection depends on the logarithm of $\lambda$, which means there are diminishing returns to increasing the adaptivity rates of travel restriction to infection. To validate this finding, $t_2$ was evaluated for different systems of ODEs with varying values of $\lambda$ and $\kappa$. As Figure~%REF figure
shows, the appoximated relationship matches the numerical results when $\lambda$ is sufficiently higher than $1/i_0$ such that $\lambda i_0 >>1$

The straight line in this plot correponds to a logarithmic dependency of $t_2$ on $\lambda$, as was found in the analytical approximation. The approximation is only valid for $\lambda > i_0$, which is $10^5$ in this case. It can be seen that before this threshold, the impact of $\lambda$ is negligible and $t_2$ has the same value as if there was no adaptivity.}
    \label{fig:t_2 and t_3 vs lambda}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}\dot I_2(t<t_{F2}) \approx f_2 = \mu i_0 e^{\kappa (1-c) t} \approx \mu i_0 e^{-\kappa c t}\end{equation}

Solving for $I_2(t)$, where $t<t_{F_2}$,

\begin{equation}I_2(t<t_{F2}) = \mu i_0 \left( \frac{e^{-\kappa c t}}{-\kappa c} - \frac{1}{-\kappa c} \right) = \frac{\mu i_0}{\kappa c}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa c t}\right) = \frac{1}{\lambda}\left(1-e^{-\kappa c t}\right) \end{equation}

After finding this approximation of $I_2$, we can then derive the evolution of $\bar \rho_3$. 

\begin{equation}\dot{\bar{\rho}}_3 = - \lambda \mu \bar{\rho}_3 \frac{1}{\lambda}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa c t}\right) =  - \mu \bar{\rho}_3\left(1 - e^{-\kappa c t}\right)\end{equation}

Seperating the variables and integrating, we arrive at the solution for $\bar \rho_3(t<t_{F2})$ 
% \begin{equation}\int \frac{d{\bar \rho_3}}{\bar \rho_3} = \int \mu ( e^{-\kappa c t} -1)\end{equation}

% \begin{equation}\ln|\bar{\rho}_3| = \frac{- \mu e^{-\kappa c t}}{\kappa c} - \mu t + C_2\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\bar \rho_3(t<t_{F2}) = \exp\left( \frac{1}{\lambda i_0} - \frac{e^{-\kappa c t}}{\lambda i_0}-\mu t\right) = \exp\left(\frac{1-e^{\kappa c t}}{\lambda i_0} - \mu t \right)\end{equation}

Since $\lambda i_0 >>0$, the expression $\frac{1-e^{\kappa c t}}{\lambda i_0} \approx 0$. Hence, $$\bar \rho_3(t<t_{F2}) \approx e^{-\mu t}$$.

Substituting $\bar \rho_3$ into $f_3(t)=\mu \bar \rho_3(t) I_3(t)$, we get:
\begin{equation}f_3(t)=\mu e^{-\mu t} \frac{1}{\lambda} \left(1-e^{-\kappa c t}\right) = \frac{\mu}{\lambda} e^{-\mu t}  \left(1-e^{-\mu \lambda i_0 t}\right)\end{equation}
Finding the indefinite integral of $f_3(t)$ $F_3(T) = \int_0^T f_3(t) dt$ (see appendix for integration)
\[
F_3(t) = \frac{1}{\lambda} \left( 1 - e^{-\mu t} - \frac{1}{1 + \lambda i_0} \left( 1 - e^{-\mu(1 + \lambda i_0) t} \right) \right) \approx \frac{1}{\lambda} \left( 1 - e^{-\mu t} \right).
\]

to find $t_3$, the time at which $I_3(t_3) = i_0$, we first integrate  $\dot I_3(t)$ for $I_3(t)<1/lambda$ where most of the growth is from incoming flow and then again for $1/\lambda<I_3(t)<i_0$.

\begin{equation}\dot I_3(t) = \kappa I_3(t) + f_3(t) = \kappa I_3(t) +\frac{\mu}{\lambda} e^{-\mu t}  \left(1-e^{-\mu \lambda i_0 t}\right)\end{equation}

This can be solved for $I_3(t)$ (see appendix)

\begin{equation}
    I_3(t) \approx \frac{\mu}{\lambda (\mu + \kappa)} \left( e^{\kappa t} - e^{-\mu t} \right).
\end{equation}

with which we can solve for $t_{F_3}$ where $I_3(t)=F_3(\infty) = 1/\lambda$
\begin{equation}I_3(t_{F_3}) \approx \frac{\mu}{\lambda (\mu + \kappa)} \left( e^{\kappa t_{F_3}} - e^{-\mu t_{F_3}} \right) \stackrel{!}{=}  \frac{1}{\lambda}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}e^{\kappa t_{F_3}} - e^{-\mu t_{F_3}} =\frac{\mu + \kappa}{\mu}\end{equation}

Since $\dot I_3(t) \approx \kappa I_3(t)$ for $t>t_{F_3}$, which has the same evolution as $I_2(t)$, then $t_3 = t_2 + t_{F_3}$. Hence 
$ \Delta t_3 = t_{F_3}$
While one cannot solve explicitly for $t$ in this equation, it is important to observe that this approximation of $t_{F_3}$ is not a function of $\lambda$, which means that one cannot decrease the spread rate of infection for the third and onwards downstream neighbors. This result was confirmed to be sufficiently accurate through numerical testing. It was found that the spread rates of the third neighbor and beyond quickly converged to the infection spread rate of the non-adaptive case. This can be seen in the analytic approximation for large values of $t_{F_3}$ where $e^{\kappa t_{F_3}} - e^{-\mu t_{F_3}}  \approx e^{\kappa t_{F_3}}$

\begin{equation}\Delta t_3 = t_{F_3} \approx \frac{1}{\kappa} \ln(1+\frac{ \kappa}{\mu})\end{equation}

This expression for $\Delta t_3$ is very close to the spread rate expression in the nonadaptive system, since $W(x) \approx \ln(1+x)$. It is numerically found that in the adaptive system, for sufficiently large $i$, 
\[
\lim_{i \to \infty} \Delta t_i \approx \frac{1}{\kappa} W\left(\frac{\kappa}{\mu}\right)
\]
Which further confirms the finding that adaptivity only introduces a delay in infection spread in the immediate neighborhood of the first infected subpopulation while the remaining metapopulation network suffers from approximately the same infection spread rate as the unadaptive system.

    \caption{\small Spread rates ($1/\Delta t$) at each subpopulation $i$ in a 1-lattice. It can be seen that $\lambda$ has the most impact on the immediate neighborhood of the subpopulation 1. Subpopulations 2 and onwards have a much more subdued influence by $\lambda$ and quickly converges to the non-adaptive spread rates. The jump that can be observed between $\lambda=10^4$ and $\lambda=10^6$ is due to surpassing the bifurcation point at $\lambda=1/i_0=10^5$. The observed rise in spread rate in the furthest subpopulation is due to having one neighbor, causing less outward diffusion as defined in \ref{eq: AH}.}

It can be seen that, with sufficiently large $\lambda >1/i_0$, the spread rate around the initial infection is significantly lowered. However, for further away subpopulations (and hence, the network average), this impact in nearly non-existant. Though it might seem that the initial spread rate is converging to a value, it is intead mearly following a $1/log(\lambda)$ curve.}

\subsection{Application to Clustered Networks}
In the previous sections, we focused on one-dimensional lattice structures (or path graphs), where each subpopulation is connected linearly. This allowed us to derive analytical estimates for infection times by considering distances from the initial infection source. However, real-world networks often possess higher clustering coefficients, which can create shortcuts and feedback loops not present in a simple path graph. In highly clustered networks, the effective distance between nodes can shrink rapidly once a community is reached, influencing the overall infection velocity. As a result, a purely linear distance approach may underestimate the speed of contagion in such regions. \\

To further illustrate this, we can consider the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and directed tree subsets of a given network. As found from the previous analysis, flow of infected individuals is highly asymmetric, where the flow downstream (from the initially infected subpopulations) is is significantly higher than that in the upstream direction, near the initial infection period. This asymmetry allows us to simplify the studied network to the downstream subset of the network connections, which is a DAG. To eliminate cross-links (links between nodes of same distance from root), we instead focus on the layered DAG. Unlike the DAG simplification, there is only one unique DAG given a specified root. Applying this simplification opens the gateway to many tools and optimizations both analytically and numerically. Furthermore, it directly shows the expected primary paths and sources of infection flow in the early stages of infection spread. To utilize the previous analysis done on path graphs, one could convert the network of interest into a directed tree graph, where only (one of) the shortest paths are kept to any given node (see \ref{fig: graph subsets}). In this case, one could predict the time of infection of any node only as a function of its distance from the root. This simplification, while insightful to networks with low clustering, is hurt the most by nodes where there are multiple shortest-distance paths from the root. \\

To account for different topological effects, more sophisticated distance measures (e.g., effective resistance distance, shortest path betweenness, or harmonic centrality) can refine predictions. These measures provide complementary insights when clustering or multiple pathways significantly alter the propagation route. Nonetheless, the essential core idea of partitioning nodes by their ‘distance shells’ from the initial infection source still applies, especially when infection flows primarily along shortest paths. The approximation of infection time to path length is sufficiently accurate due to the geometric decay of the number of infected individuals $I_j$ at a given point in time. In the unadaptive 1-lattice, the solution for $I_j$ is given by:
\[
I_j = I_0 \frac{\mu^{j-1} t^{j-1}}{(j-1)!} e^{\kappa t},
\]
which forms a decaying geometric series as a function of time. When the decay factor $\mu$ is small enough, the net flow from two downstream paths of different lengths into a patch will be disproportionately impacted by the shorter path. This approximation holds particularly well around $t=0$, where the initial infection spread is most critical.

For a node $j$ at distance $d_j$ from the initially infected source under a chosen metric, we can write:
\[
t_{d_j} \approx d_j \cdot \Delta t,
\]
where $\Delta t$ is the characteristic infection time step derived in the 1-lattice analysis. Each distance shell’s nominal infection time can be adjusted by weighing the clustering properties or alternative network metrics, providing a first-order approximation before detailed simulations confirm or refine these predictions.
