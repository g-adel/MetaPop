\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces \small  The same plot of the infected evolution in log-y scale. Zero-values of infection have been omitted from this plot, all of which exist at day 1. This scale helps show that the first subpopulation starts at an initial infected prevalence of $i_0=1e-5$ and the grows exponentially, which can be seen by the constant-slope line of the evolution with a slope $1/\kappa $. This same exponential evolution can also be seen for subpopulation 2, quickly reaches the value of $F_2$ when $\rho _{2,1}$ reaches 1. A later figure will show the growth towards this value. Interestingly, the remainder of the subpopulations have a non-linear slope until it reaches the same threshold $F_2$ at which point their respective restriction completely shut down and their behavior turns purely exponential}}{5}{}\protected@file@percent }

It is worthy of note here that most $\rho $ values reach 1 significantly before the populaiton's corresponsponding infected prevalence reaches any significant value. It can be also seen from this plot that $\rho _2$ reaches 1 before the second day of the scenario, while $rho_3$ has a non-zero initial growth rate.}}{5}{}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {6}{\ignorespaces \small  Evaluation of $t_2$ for different $\lambda $ and $\kappa $ values with the $t_2$ approximation in a log-x scale. The straight line in this plot correponds to a logarithmic dependency of $t_2$ on $\lambda $, as was found in the analytical approximation. The approximation is only valid for $\lambda > i_0$, which is $10^5$ in this case. It can be seen that before this threshold, the impact of $\lambda $ is negligible and $t_2$ has the same value as if there was no adaptivity.}}{7}{}\protected@file@percent }
