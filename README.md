# Adaptive Metapopulaton Networks Epidemics Simulation and Analysis

This module numerically simulates and analyzes an SIRS epidemic spread on Metapopulation networks of various topologies. 

This code was used to implement the computational side of a Master's thesis done by Gamal Adel at the Technical University of Munich.
